    "description": "Hello, I'm Jenn! Most of my career experience has been in research, which eventually culminated into a counseling psychology Ph.D. I was able to achieve this with the use of the scientific method--implementing theory and statistical analyses to better understand human behavior (and its resulting psychological/ behavioral outcomes).",
    "description2": "As I've grown an interest in coding, I've become fond of how the coding process works. That is, applying the critical thinking skills I've used for research to be relevant in the tech industry.",
    "description3": "I'm excited to bridge the power of creating applications with the research skills I've accumulated, in hopes of becoming a creative developer (with my potentially unique educational background).",
    "etc": "In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games. I personally enjoy watching competitive Overwatch, as well as getting wrecked in competitive mode and dropping to bronze. Just kidding~ it's definitely rewarding to win matches though!",
